			<h2>Career Summary</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="container">
			<p class="justify">
				After post-graduation, I started working for Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, Nasik Division and 
				then onwards worked in many companies spanning a period of more than 33 years covering different 
				functional areas.
			</p>
			<p class="justify">
				After retiring from industry, I took up teaching assignments as a way of keeping myself busy and now
				I started my own company "SUSHIKSHANA CONSULTANCY" to cater to on-line teaching requirements. 
				This involves setting up my own site loaded with teaching materials. It involves development of mobile apps.
				So many plans for the future...
